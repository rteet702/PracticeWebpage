            <h2>A little about my life</h2>
            <p>Hello! Chances are that since you're here, you'd like to learn a little more about me! My name is Robert, I'm originally from Round Lake Beach, Illinois, but now I live in beautiful Grand Lake, Colorado! Currently for work, I'm a ski / bike patroller providing basic EMS to anyone who may need it. I've always had an interest in Software Development, as well as coding in general.</p>
            <p>My interest for coding first started back in 2008, when I discovered a game called Roblox. Essentially, Roblox is somewhat of a game engine, (more so now than it was back then), that primarily had you develop with Lua. Since then, I've spent a lot of time toying around with other languages like C#, Python, C++, C, and HTML. Now, I've finally decided it's time for me to commit to the bit and begin my journey down this career path.</p>
            <h2>My Goals</h2>
            <p>Currently, I'm a student going through the Part Time Accelerated 3 Full Stack course provided by Coding Dojo! I'm hoping with the time I spend in the course, I'll be able to achieve these goals.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Become proficient in at LEAST three different full stacks of software development.</li>
                <li>Build my confidence in the person I am and the work I offer.</li>
                <li>Use that newfound confidence to begin the application process.</li>
                <li>Spend my time working on one of my biggest passion projects: Build an open-source framework for web-based banking applications.</li>
                <li>Hire on and begin my career as a full stack software developer.</li>
                <li>Find new ways every day to continue my learning and hopefully spread the knowledge I gain along the way.</li>
            </ul>
